Awesome, right!?\r\n\r\nWhen starting with git use [SourceTree.](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) It shows you everything in an easy to understand way, while being a true git client. (don’t use the GitHub application. Just don’t. It will learn you (almost) nothing about git. It will break and then you will be lost without a clue how to fix it).\r\n\r\n![don't become this guy](http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/4/4d/git.png)  \r\n↑ don't become this guy.\r\n\r\nOn linux? Use [GitKraken](http://www.gitkraken.com/). [It is still in beta though.](http://aztechbeat.com/2015/10/axosofts-gitkraken-undo-button-git-private-beta/) If you are a command-line lover you can also use that.\r\n\r\n##What is git and how does it use version control\r\nhttp://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control  \r\nVersion control? Wha?\r\n\r\nhttps://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics  \r\nWhat are the ideas behind git?\r\n\r\n\r\n##How do I use git?\r\nhttps://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1  \r\nTry a few git commands. Don’t worry if you don’t remember the exact commands. SourceTree will have buttons for it and handle the exact code in the background.\r\n\r\nhttps://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell  \r\nWhat were those branches?\r\n\r\nhttps://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging#Basic-Merge-Conflicts  \r\nWhen combining stuff, it might not always go to plan.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-reset  \r\nThese changes are not going to work out. It isn’t me, it’s you.\r\n\r\nhttp://gitready.com/beginner/2009/01/10/stashing-your-changes.html  \r\nStashing. How to put your code to the side for a while.\r\n\r\nhttps://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#Ignoring-Files  \r\n.gitignore is very important to you too. Many eclipse files need to be excluded, just like all the compiled files in your bin folder. (Nobody will want to see these changes).  P.S. GitHub can also create a standard gitignore for you. \r\n\r\n![standard git committing](https://qeme4g-sn3301.files.1drv.com/y3pPRaYV2vMs1SiNPqP2x5E4kmUxlhx2OprNUrGnOVTwSDoV9A1MJ1Gp9VVjefB4b4rG9c96_8aEOVShQIvy0__Ejm0jz7wY7rvCzWj7TAAdsu1kBAEjPhL0M6b0RlKgxIE/Git-HowTo.png?psid=1)\r\n\r\n##Git is hard\r\nDon’t worry if you don’t understand it all in one go. It gets better with time.\r\n\r\n##Workflow (Optional, but makes your life easier)\r\nOk, I now know how people work with git. How should I be applying it?  \r\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/centralized-workflow  \r\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request  \r\n\r\nThey were talking about something called a pull request. Pull whatta?  \r\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow (Until “Where To Go From Here”)  \r\n\r\nGitflow will make your life a lot easier. No-one wants to merge your work of the entire week and has time to review it all.  \r\nhttps://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/  \r\nUse gitflow in GitHub\r\n##Wanna see something cool?
