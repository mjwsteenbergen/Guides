#Git-How to
##Before you start
https://education.github.com/pack  
Free stuff. Awesome, right!?

When starting with git use [SourceTree.](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) It shows you everything in an easy to understand way, while being a true git client. (don’t use the GitHub application. Just don’t. It will learn you (almost) nothing about git. It will break and then you will be lost without a clue how to fix it).

On linux? Use [GitKraken](http://www.gitkraken.com/). [It is still in beta though.](http://aztechbeat.com/2015/10/axosofts-gitkraken-undo-button-git-private-beta/) If you are a command-line lover you can also use that.

##What is git and how does it use version control

##How do I use git?
https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1  
Try a few git commands. Don’t worry if you don’t remember the exact commands. SourceTree will have buttons for it and handle the exact code in the background.

When combining stuff, it might not always go to plan.

.gitignore is very important to you too. Many eclipse files need to be excluded, just like all the compiled files in your bin folder. (Nobody will want to see these changes).  P.S. GitHub can also create a standard gitignore for you.

##Git is hard
Don’t worry if you don’t understand it all in one go. It gets better with time.

##Workflow (Optional, but makes your life easier)
Ok, I now know how people work with git. How should I be applying it?  
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/centralized-workflow  
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request  

They were talking about something called a pull request. Pull whatta?

Gitflow will make your life a lot easier. No-one wants to merge your work of the entire week and has time to review it all.

No-one wants to see if your tests are succeeding by pulling your branch and locally running the tests. This service will take all your commits and run tests on them. Great for annoying your teammates that their tests are not succeeding.
